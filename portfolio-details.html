              As AI technology advances, most jobs will be imparted by Artificial Intelligence, automation, and
robotics in some way or form. The degree and level of impact will depend on a number of factors. We
cannot generalize the potential outcome for one profession over the other.
The premise was that soon robots would do all the work and nobody would have a job but that
was OK because at that point everyone could get a free allowance to buy the things we needed. As a
computer engineering, I thought this was ridiculous. Some people or graduates are the ones most afraid of
losing their job due to Artificial Intelligence development. About 68.5% of them fear being replaced by
AI, compared to just 55% of others non-worker. Cashiers and drivers are the most likely to be taken over
by AI technology. Some claim that AI could prevent corruption and improve the company if we put a lot
of faith in Artificial Intelligence.
Customer care chatbots are a typical example of how AI could replace our jobs. Because some
message intent in the chat box was identified using machine learning and natural language processing. It
can rapidly scan communications and offer succinct responses to frequently asked questions. Most
businesses utilize it to save costs and enhance customer satisfaction.
As time pass by more and more people are open to the idea of incorporating AI into their daily
lives. They do not mind AI taking over everyday tasks or being involved in decision-making processes.
On the other hand, AI adoption is fraught with doubts and concerns about AI risks. Here are some of the
most interesting trends that have caught our eye.
