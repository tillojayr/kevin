              In our world today, technology is going faster and its evolution is uncontrollable. It is
everywhere and becomes part of our life may in our personal or not. It is also used across
different industries starting from mere machines to Artificial Intelligence (AI). Artificial
Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed
to think like humans and split their reactions. It may also be applied to any machine that exhibits
traits associated with human minds such as learning and solving problem. It has also the ability
to rationalize and takes actions that have the best chance of achieving a specific goal.
The video introduces the new age we are in right now, Artificial Intelligence. It
emphasizes that AI started in our environment and evolved so fast. Due to advanced technology,
the application of artificial intelligence almost surpasses humankind. Some are not actually
aware of because what they knew of AI are just a machine and a robot that work itself. With the
continuous revolution that pave way in our planet, a lot of things bloomed, created, and were
given life. These modifications gave way for the productivity and evolution which made life
easier. Technology advancements were made, and everything seems possible. Human labors
were replaced by machine work, and people started building strong foundations regarding
sciences and its branches. As technology arises, buildings and infrastructures were also built.
Appliances were now used to ease daily tasks and chores, and even in different fields, the use of
technology were greatly visible. From the smallest areas, such as houses, down to the larger
ones, like laboratories and space conservatories, technologies existence was still present. No
wonder that one day, robots and/or artificial and digital human-like images will socialize and
merge with human populations.
The study involving robotics had been greatly majored, scientist started to analyze,
create, observe, and work on this digital human-like copy of oneself. Artificial intelligence or
also known as A.I was given birth; inventions and developments were created in order to help
humankind in different aspects. Machine learning, algorithm, computer vision, and big data,
became the new trend in the vocabulary. With A.I machines were taught, and became smart.
Machines were simulated with intelligence behaviors. Cooperation between human and machine
became possible, thanks to A.I.
Integrating the use of Artificial Intelligence (A.I) in the field of engineering, this will be a
great help towards century engineers and students. Using A.I in studying will be a great edge for
students, at the same time, for engineers, to reach the highest standard peak towards
achievement. This will be a help to know the different possibilities regarding studies, and this
will in gathering information and data needed, most especially when conducting research studies.
Through A.I have its limitations in terms of moral aspects, we can still use this in developing,
enhancing, and improving engineering student capabilities. They can learn with the aide of this
thing, and will also built their comprehension and socialization skills. Aside from this, our
society can also benefit from the use of A.I. Certain activities and/or programs that needs man
labor, can be replaced by machines. Through this, workloads will not be a burden anymore,
machine can do it in a quick and swift manner.
