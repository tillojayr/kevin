            <p>
              I start with some questions first, What constitutes art? What does love mean? These issues have
been the subject of millennia of human speculation, discussion, and argument. As scientists get closer to
reducing these ideas to a science, artificial intelligence (A.I. In projects, alternatives to romantic partners
and artists in their own right are getting closer.
Mostly artist builds a concept that becomes closer mostly defining love and ending in a good
story. But in Sciences AIâ€™s role is defined as an intuitive challenge in our society.
Artist creates both precious and protective creativity that ineffable thing on learning and
improving the creative process. This is the reason that much of AI is being overlooked. It is more
comfortable to relegate AI as a tool for automation of the grunt work. It can automate many taxes but it
can help in creating art. Otherwise, it generates in the video I watch based on the creative approach to
raising something.
A startup called Realbotix makes life-size human dolls for companionship. Realbotix collaborates
with an AI expert to develop the technology that would let the dolls communicate with the people they are
with. To understand how a person is feeling, the dolls can also read human emotions. One of a director
who uses exclusively artificial intelligence (AI)-written scripts to make his films. Sharp inserts human-
written screenplays into Benjamin, a machine learning software, and then makes movies based on the
scripts Benjamin produces. He always adheres to the script exactly. The episode discusses their most
recent film, Bobo and Girlfriend, which is based on more action movie plots written by humans.
Lastly, the way AI works is complicated and unpredictable. In some jobs, AI performs at a
human- or superhuman-level; in others (or occasionally the same tasks), it makes mistakes that a child
would avoid or generates outcomes that are completely illogical. Even while the riddles of AI may not
have a single solution or follow a clear path, they should make us wonder.
